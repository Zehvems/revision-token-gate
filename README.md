# Revision Token Gate — v0.01

This is not a SaaS.
This is a behavior test.

## What this tests

Whether a solo copywriter will copy and send a ready-made message
that sets a revision limit after final delivery.

## Moment of truth

The moment a client asks for a “small change” after final.

## Success signal

Message copied (and ideally sent) in a real client conversation.

## What this is NOT

- project management tool
- pricing system
- dashboard
